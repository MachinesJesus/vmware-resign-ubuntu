# vmware-resign-ubuntu

This file re-signed the VMWARE Drivers for Ubuntu 19.10 upgrades, the VMVARE drivers would fail 
due to the continual kernel upgrades. 

The problem is that it does not seem to be working with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. 
Also, my VMWARE is not working on the PC that I upgraded to 20.04 LTS. 

I have not yet solved the transition of a Windows VM running on VMWare from Ubuntu 19.10 to 20.04 LTS. 

This script is based on a stack overflow post. Need to find it to reference this.
